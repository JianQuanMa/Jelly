//Bonus if you include a README with your thought process, tradeoffs, and any design sketches.
      App needs to be as concise and cimple as possible since user will liekly focus on the centents instead of wantting to be distracted by info unrelated to videos. So 
  mianly took inspiration from tiktok's UI design. Tradeoff is we lose some originalities and I hadr coded something since we want to devilier it fast, so we are tarding 
  testability for meeting the deadline. No sketches as I code while loooking at the tiktok design.
